Two-Bit!

This language is still in the developmental stages!  This means that things can change quickly.  Whenever changes happen, all old compilers will be left alone, but a new folder will be added with the new compiler.  If code from somewhere else isn't working, make sure you have the correct version of the compiler!

Command List:

* 0-Separates commands
* 1-Adds top of stack to its argument.  Not providing any argument results in top of stack being doubled
* 2-Subtracts its argument from top of stack.  Not providing any argument results in top of stack being zeroed
* 3-Multiplies its argument and top of stack.  Not providing any argument results in top of stack being squared
* 11-Divides top of stack by its argument.  Not providing any argument results in top of stack becoming 1


More coming soon!
